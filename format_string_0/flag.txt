first, we have to give input larger than 2*buffsize ie 2*32, but the options in the menu
is not larger. Since the ip is printed directly with format strings, this specific item "Gr%114d_Cheese"
has %114d format specifier which will create 114 garbage values. so the limit exceeds 64 if we select this item as choice1
as we go to next one.

here, if we crash the segmentation and we can get the flag. to do this, select "Cla%sic_Che%s%steak" this as our choice2
the %s in there will look for string input to replace. since it cant find any strings input to replace, it will crash
